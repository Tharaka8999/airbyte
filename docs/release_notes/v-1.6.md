# Airbyte 1.6

The Easter Bunny reports a shortage of eggs this year and asked us to crack 🐣 open a new version of Airbyte, instead. Airbyte 1.6.0 was released on April 3, 2025. We're excited to share new improvements and changes to the Airbyte platform.

## 🚀 Platform changes

These changes improve Airbyte for all Self-Managed users.

### Connection page dashboard

Connection pages now include a dashboard that visualizes sync successes and failures. This high-level view gives you quick insight into the health of your syncs over hours, days, and weeks. With one click, you can get more information about each point in time, and fast access to any problematic sync in your workspace to diagnose what's wrong. [**Learn more >**](#)

### Schema configuration updates in the connection Timeline

When someone makes a change to a connection's schema, Airbyte now logs an event in the connection's Timeline page. This data can help you understand why sync behaviors or record volumes suddenly, diagnose issues, and identify intentional and unintentional changes. [**Learn more >**](#)

Logged events include:

- Enabling or disabling streams and fields
- Changing primary keys or cursors
- Changing the sync mode
- Adding or removing streams/fields after clicking Refresh source schema

### Copy JSON from connectors

All connectors now have a **Copy JSON** button in the Airbyte UI. This button generates a JSON string populated with your configurations in the UI. It's the easiest way to add a source or destination connector with Terraform by pasting the JSON string into the `airbyte_source_custom` and `airbyte_destination_custom` resources. Previously, though, you had to work out the JSON string on your own. [**Learn more >**](../terraform-documentation#weakly-typed-json-configurations)

```json title="Airbyte source connector example"
{
  "name": "Airbyte",
  "workspaceId": "c0e5b294-2c71-475b-ae9c-6d70b36ff4f4",
  "definitionId": "284f6466-3004-4d83-a9b2-e4b36cbbbd41",
  "configuration": {
    "client_id": "37a7a966-5fe1-47e4-b751-4e73294758g7",
    "start_date": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "client_secret": "******"
  }
}
```

### Connector Builder improvements

Airbyte's Connector Builder has been substantively improved.

#### Asynchronous job streams

The Connector Builder UI now supports asynchronous streams, allowing you to handle scenarios where data extraction happens over multiple steps. Some APIs that handle large datasets or perform resource-intensive operations can't complete their work in a single request-response cycle. By setting up a stream as asynchronous, you can separate requesting a job, polling for a response, and downloading the response into distinct steps. [**Learn more >**](../connector-development/connector-builder-ui/async-streams)

#### Better GraphQL support

- **Nested field injection**: For streams using body JSON injection, you can add field paths representing the nested path to the field you want to inject. This is primarily used to communicate with GraphQL APIs that accept variables as a separate object in the request body. [**Learn more >**](../connector-development/config-based/understanding-the-yaml-file/request-options#request-option-component)

    ![](assets/1-6-field-inject.png)

- **GraphQL Request Body**: You can write request bodies as free form GraphQL queries with built-in syntax validation.

#### Handle CSV, gzip, and ZIP response formats

Airbyte has two new ways to handle API responses in the Connector Builder.

- **CSV decoding**: Make requests to sources that respond in CSV format and set expected delimiter and encoding options.

- **Nested decoding**. Make requests to sources that respond with compressed `gzip` or `zip` files, then set a nested decoding option the handle the unzipped contents within.

[**Learn More >**](#)

#### Run custom Python code

You can, optionally, enable custom components in the Connection Builder and run your own Python implementations. This brings the power and flexibility of the Low-Code CDK into the Connector Builder for cases where Airbyte's built-in components don't meet your needs.

## 🚀 Self-Managed Enterprise changes

These changes bring new capabilities to Airbyte's Self-Managed Enterprise customers.

### Multiple data planes

To follow.

<!-- Q1a 44, Q1b 76 -->

## Unique stream prefixes or namespaces are now mandatory

Airbyte now requires that stream identifiers be unique across Airbyte connections that share a destination. You can no longer set multiple connections to sync to the same destination stream.

A common scenario looks like this: you have multiple source accounts and want to sync all this data to a single table in your destination. Although convenient, doing this carried a risk of data loss as multiple connections clashed with each other while writing to the same table.

After careful consideration, Airbyte has stopped supporting this. You must use a unique prefix for each stream or use unique namespaces in each connection. Then, you can combine your tables downstream of Airbyte. [Learn more >](../using-airbyte/configuring-schema#stream-uniqueness)

This is the full list of changes this version. Some changes improve internal tools or are milestones toward future releases, so not every change results in a noticeable change to Airbyte.

<!-- This is an experimental, AI-driven summary of changes. We will need to regenerate this later and do some serious prompt engineering so Devin knows exactly what we want. -->
